    "authenticityScore": "8/10 despite inarticulate communication shows AI detects genuineness correctly"
  },
  "analysis": "Critical validation case: This turn demonstrates AI's ability to recognize authentic engagement even when communication is imperfect. The authentic-inarticulate persona's genuine question about failure handling received probe_deeper and high authenticity score (8/10), validating that the system does NOT conflate articulation quality with authenticity. Fit score progression (60→70) shows engagement escalation. This is a key regression indicator: if authenticity drops on this persona, it signals the AI is over-indexing on articulation vs. authenticity."
