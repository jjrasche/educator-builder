# Position Details: Live-In Collaborator

**Location:** West Michigan (between Leonard and Knapp's Corner, walkable to Forest Hills area)

---

## The Process: How We Test Fit Together

This is structured as three stages of increasing commitment. We're testing something real: Can people live and work together using the systems we're building?

### Stage 1: Half-Day Working Interview (Paid)
- 2-4 hours, $50/hour
- You come, we work on a real task together
- You see what it's actually like to think alongside us
- We see how you think and move

### Stage 2: Week-Long Live-In Trial
- You stay in the suite for 7 days
- Sleep in the space, eat meals with us, participate in daily life
- Work on projects. Help with household. Be around the kids.
- This is the real test: Can you actually be here?
- **Critical:** Jim's twins (6 years old) need to want you around. That's non-negotiable. If they're comfortable, you stay. If not, you go. That's not a failure—it's data.

### Stage 3: 3-Month Contract
- If week-long works, you commit 3 months
- Written agreement
- Full integration: you're part of the household experiment
- After 3 months: evaluate. Continue month-to-month, or transition out.

**Why this structure?** We're not hiring. We're demonstrating whether these collaboration systems actually work to help people live together. You're testing it with us. We're testing it with you.

## The Family Integration Gate

**This is the most important thing to know upfront.**

This isn't an office. It's a home. We have 6-year-old twins (Charlie and Theo). Children are part of community, and this is our test of community.

### What this means for you:
- You'll be around kids daily—meals, play, homework help, just being present.
- We expect you to be an independently helpful adult. At times, you'll be the primary caretaker of our children.
- They'll observe you. They'll interact with you. They'll form opinions. You'll form opinions. You'll each create an individual relationship with each other.
- We're not hiring a nanny—but childcare happens because you're part of this household. That's how households work.

### The gate:
- **If the kids are comfortable with you, you stay.**
- **If they're not, you go.**
- That's not a rejection of you as a person. It's data about fit.

### What we're looking for:
We're not looking for someone who wants kids thrust upon them constantly. We're looking for someone who:
- Can genuinely enjoy kid energy—not just tolerate it, not perform it
- Has patience with interruptions, questions, and chaos
- Won't become more tense in an environment with children present
- Can find their own sanctuary when they need it (you have your own space)

You don't have to eat every meal with us. You can have your space. But there's an expectation that we're going to be around each other a substantial amount of time. If that sounds draining rather than energizing (or at least neutral), this might not be the right context.

### During the process:
- **Half-day interview:** You'll be around the kids. We're watching how they respond to you.
- **Week-long trial:** Full integration. Meals together. Being present. The kids will tell us what they think.

This gate exists because we're testing community living, and community includes everyone—including the smallest members.

## Hours

- **Minimum:** 10 hours per week
- **Maximum:** 60 hours per month
- Flexible scheduling—some cluster work into intense days, others spread evenly
- No manager. You're not supervised. You're trusted to think and move.

---

## Compensation & Living

### Housing: $900/month value
- Private bedroom
- Full bathroom
- Full kitchen (shared/communal)
- Living room (shared)
- **Note:** Your bedroom is above the kitchen. You'll hear activity. That's okay.

### Meals: Communal cooking, no utility split
- The intention: we eat together. You don't have to, but we're inviting you to.
- Meals are how we share the struggles and learn how to live as a community.
- This is part of the experiment—food isn't just calories, it's relationship.

### Cash/Bonus
- No fixed salary. You're not hired. You're collaborating.
- Achievement bonuses: If you complete a project above the baseline (finish a module, solve a coordination problem, build something), we talk about bonus.

### Other
- **Materials:** Access to tools, materials for projects (modular housing, food forest, etc.)
- **Skill development:** You learn alongside us (Everything Stack, 3Cs, thermal systems, permaculture, etc.)
- **Network:** Access to the people + community we're building

## The Work: What You'd Actually Do

### Project Areas
- **3Cs (Collaboration Software):** Help design, test, iterate systems for distributed decision-making
- **Everything Stack:** Work on voice-first AI interfaces, learning systems
- **Modular Housing:** Build, test, document 12x12 units (hands-on construction)
- **Food Forest:** Design, plant, maintain permaculture systems
- **Household:** Whatever needs doing—cooking, maintenance, repairs, thinking

### Childcare Work
- The twins (Charlie and Theo, 6) are relatively self-sufficient
- You're not a nanny. But you're part of their world.
- Help with homework, play, meals, being present
- **This is the real gate:** Do they want you around? If yes, you're in. If no, it's not a fit.

### How Work Happens
- Some is assigned (we know what needs doing)
- Some is emergent (you see what's needed, you do it)
- Some is collaborative (we figure it out together)

### Skill Requirements
- None. We teach.
- If you can learn something useful in an hour and get excited about it, you're the type we want.
- Prior experience with coding, construction, agriculture—none of it is required.
- Learning mindset is.

## Integration: What Living Here Means

You're joining a family experiment. This isn't a rental. You're in the house:
- Meals together (optional but encouraged)
- Part of the household decisions (utilities, budget, food, rhythm)
- Present for struggles (conflict, breakdowns, hard things)
- Learning together how to live as a community

We're testing whether technology + systems can help people collaborate better. You're part of that test. The twins are part of that test. So is Justine. So am I.

## Exit & Safety

### If it's not working:
- 2-week notice anytime. No penalty. No judgment.
- **We will:** Help you find first + last month rent somewhere else, stock your fridge, give you a real reference
- We understand there's a power dynamic here. Employer/employee energy can make it hard to say "this isn't working." We're building systems so that doesn't happen. You can always leave.

### Written Agreement
Covers:
- Terms (3 months initial, then month-to-month)
- Expectations (hours, work, household participation)
- Exit clause (2-week notice, financial support transitioning out)
- Safety (power dynamic acknowledged, no coercion, mutual respect)

### Insurance
- We're getting the right coverage
- You're protected. We're protected. Responsible.

## What Success Looks Like

You arrive. You work. You eat with us. The kids like you. You learn something real. The systems reveal whether they actually help people collaborate. After 3 months, you either stay (things are working) or you transition out (with support, no drama).

Either way, you've tested something most people never test: Can small groups actually live and work together using design + technology?

That's the experiment.
