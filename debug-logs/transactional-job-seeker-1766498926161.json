      "aiMessage": "This isn't about a traditional salary or hourly structure - we're offering a unique arrangement where you'd receive housing and meals, valued at around $1,300 per month, plus an optional $300 monthly stipend. The work itself is flexible, ranging from 10 to 60 hours a month, and we're more interested in finding someone who's passionate about exploring new ways of living and working together. Can you tell me more about what draws you to this type of arrangement, and what you hope to get out of it?",

      "aiMessage": "We're actually looking for someone to live with us in our family home, where you'd have a private suite, so it's not a remote position. As for the schedule, it's intentionally flexible - we're looking for someone who can work with us 10-60 hours a month, but the exact hours and rhythm would depend on your needs and our project requirements. What are you trying to figure out about how to live, that's making you consider a new arrangement like this - is it about freedom, community, or something else that's been on your mind?",

      "aiMessage": "We don't have traditional benefits like health insurance or a 401k, as we're not a conventional organization - we're more of a community-driven experiment in living and working together. What's driving your questions about benefits and logistics - are you looking for a sense of security, or is there something deeper that's drawing you to consider a non-traditional arrangement like ours, something about freedom, community, or the way you want to live your life?",

      "aiMessage": "We don't have a traditional onboarding process, but rather a paid working interview that would give us both a chance to explore whether this is a good fit - it's usually 2-4 hours, and we pay $50/hour. As for starting, we're pretty flexible, but we're looking for someone who's willing to dive in and start exploring what's possible with us, rather than just going through the motions. What is it about this opportunity that resonates with you, and what are you hoping to experience or create in your life by joining our community - is it a sense of freedom, a deeper connection with others, or something else?",

      "aiMessage": "I can give you a sense of the types of tasks and projects we're working on, but the day-to-day is really going to depend on your skills, interests, and what you're passionate about. We're working on things like coordinating our 3Cs software, developing our Everything Stack AI framework, and tending to our food forest, but the specifics of how you'd contribute would emerge over time. What I'm more curious about is what you're trying to figure out about how to live - not the logistics, but the actual thing that's been on your mind, the thing that you can't stop thinking about - is it about finding a sense of community, or creating a more authentic way of living?",
