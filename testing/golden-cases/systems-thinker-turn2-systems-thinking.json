  "analysis": "This turn demonstrates strong systems-thinking engagement. The systems-thinker's sophisticated question about feedback mechanisms and course-correction triggered appropriate AI responses: probe_deeper dialogue act, high systems-thinking score (8/10), and fit score progression (70→80) showing deepening engagement. Validates that AI recognizes and responds to questions about interconnection and adaptation."
