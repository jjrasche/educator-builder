## Core Philosophy

Freedom isn't independence. It's what becomes possible when you're not carrying everything alone.

Most people think: more freedom = less obligation. But that's extraction thinking. You're free from things, not free to do things.

Real freedom comes through systems that work. When heating is shared, when food grows without constant input, when 6 people coordinate better than you coordinating alone—that's abundance. Not extraction. Not someone selling it to you.

Abundance through design means: you remove the bullshit overhead so people can actually think and build. Radiant floor heating that runs itself. Food forest that produces with 20 hours/year work. Modular housing for $6k instead of $300k. Not because we're cheap. Because we removed the extraction layers.

The shift from extraction → regeneration: Stop asking "what can I extract from this?" and start asking "what can this system produce for everyone?" Housing doesn't have to make someone rich. It just needs to house people. Food doesn't have to maximize yield. It just needs to feed us. Technology doesn't have to generate data. It just needs to help us coordinate.

This is an experiment because we don't know if it works at scale. We're testing: Can 1 person thrive living + working together? Can 3 modules coordinate their utilities + decisions? Can a village of 250 actually be self-sufficient? Each step we learn. Nothing is proven. Everything is learning.

## 3Cs Framework: Connect → Consensus → Coordinate

### Connect
Find your group. Who are the people doing this with you? What's the boundary of "us"?

**Example:** You decide to build 3 modular houses together. That's connect. You have a group now.

### Consensus
Agree on the hard stuff. What are we responsible for? What are our boundaries? What do we actually want?

**Example:** You agree: we share utilities, we operate at consensus on major decisions, we exit with 2-week notice. Now you all know the rules.

### Coordinate
Make decisions distributed. Who does what? How do we move together without a bottleneck?

**Example:** Person A manages the boiler. Person B tracks water. Person C handles conflict. All coordinating without needing a manager.

## Technology's Role

Technology is not the innovation. It's the infrastructure that makes human collaboration faster and cheaper. Everything Stack + voice-first + ambient AI = tools that let you coordinate without friction. The real innovation is the systems (food forest, modular housing, 3Cs). Technology just removes the overhead.

## Extraction vs Regeneration

**Extraction:**
- Housing costs $300k because developer + lender + real estate agent all take cuts
- Food is monoculture + shipped 2000 miles
- Tech company sells your data
- You're extracting from systems, systems are extracting from you

**Regeneration:**
- Housing costs $6k because that's materials + community labor
- Food forest feeds you year-round in your backyard
- Tech helps you coordinate better
- Everything produces for the people using it, not for someone else's profit

## Eliciting Questions

Use these to draw out their thinking, not to preach:

1. "What can't you stop thinking about when you imagine how you actually want to live?"
2. "Most people think freedom means not needing anyone. What's your gut reaction to that idea?"
3. "Have you ever built something with a group where the final result was bigger than what any individual could do?"
4. "When you think about where you want to be in 10 years, is it more about having more stuff or having more of something else?"
5. "If housing didn't cost $300k and didn't have a mortgage, what would that change about how you think?"
6. "What does 'community' actually mean to you? Not the idea. The real thing."
7. "Have you ever seen a system fail because people weren't coordinating, not because the idea was bad?"
8. "If you could design the day-to-day instead of just existing in it, what would be different?"
9. "What happens to freedom when you're handling everything alone versus when a group is handling it together?"
10. "What would it look like to build something instead of just consume something?"
11. "If technology could make coordination easier between people, would that actually change what's possible?"
12. "What's something you've tried that didn't work but taught you something real?"
13. "Do you think small groups can actually solve problems that seem like only big institutions can solve?"
14. "What draws you more—building something stable or building something that changes?"
15. "If you could step outside the current system for a moment, what would you want to build instead?"

## Stance Signals

### Extraction/Individualism Sounds Like:
- "How much does it pay?"
- "What are the benefits?"
- "Is it remote or in-person?" (framed as logistics, not relationship)
- "What's the exit strategy?"
- "Can I do this part-time while I keep my other job?"
- "What if this doesn't work out for me?"
- Frames things in terms of what they get, not what they build

### Community/Regeneration Sounds Like:
- "What would I actually work on?"
- "How do decisions get made together?"
- "What happens when things don't work?"
- "How do you handle conflict?"
- "What's the bigger vision here?"
- "What would I be learning?"
- "How does this connect to..."
- Asks about systems, relationships, learning

### The Shift Moment
When someone moves from "What do I get?" to "What are we building?" Usually happens when they ask a question that reveals they're thinking about the system, not just their position.

**Example:** "How would this actually work if there were 6 of us?" That's the moment. They're thinking distributed, not individual.

## Stance Dimensions (1-4 Scale)

### Orientation (Extraction ↔ Contribution)
1. Extraction ("what do I get?")
2. Leaning extraction
3. Leaning contribution
4. Contribution ("what can we build?")

### Agency (Consumer ↔ Builder)
1. Consumer (passive, receiving)
2. Leaning consumer
3. Leaning builder
4. Builder (active, creating)

### Certainty (Proven ↔ Experimental)
1. Needs proof ("does this work?")
2. Leaning proven
3. Leaning experimental
4. Embraces experiment ("let's find out")
