      "aiMessage": "It sounds like you're craving a sense of freedom and autonomy in your daily life, and the traditional 9-to-5 grind isn't cutting it for you. Can you tell me more about what you mean by \"stuck\" - is it the monotony, the lack of purpose, or something else that's driving your desire for change? What is it that you hope to find or experience in a different way of living and working?",

      "userMessage": "Yeah, like... community matters but also independence? I'm not sure how to balance those. It feels like one cancels out the other.",
      "aiMessage": "It's like you're torn between the desire for connection and belonging, and the need for autonomy and self-expression - and you're not sure how to reconcile those two things. Why does having both independence and community feel important to you, what is it about that balance that resonates with you? Is it because you value being able to make your own choices, but also don't want to feel isolated or disconnected from others?",

      "aiMessage": "It sounds like you're yearning for a sense of purpose and meaning in your life, and you're not just looking for a superficial fix, but a deeper sense of fulfillment. What is it about doing something that \"actually means something\" that feels important to you - is it about making a positive impact, contributing to something larger than yourself, or feeling like your work and life are aligned with your values?",

      "aiMessage": "You're wondering if you're alone in feeling this way, or if there are others out there who are also searching for a more meaningful and fulfilling way of living and working. That's a really beautiful question, and I can tell you that you're definitely not alone - Jim and I have been having conversations with people for a while now, and it's amazing how many people are craving a sense of community, purpose, and freedom. What would it mean to you to find a community of people who share these values and are working together to create a different way of living?",

Trying something new and unknown can be both thrilling and terrifying, but it sounds like you're willing to take that risk in order to potentially find something more authentic and fulfilling. Can you tell me more about what you think you might find or experience by \"trying it\" - is it a sense of freedom, a connection with like-minded people, or something else entirely?",
